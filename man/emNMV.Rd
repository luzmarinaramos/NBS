\title{Maximum Likelihood Estimators for Multivariate Normal}
\usage{
emNMV(y)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{A numeric matrix of size \eqn{n \times p}, where each row
corresponds to an observation and each column to a variable.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements:
\item{mu_est}{A numeric vector of length \eqn{p}, the estimated mean vector.}
\item{sigma_est}{A \eqn{p \times p} covariance matrix, the estimated covariance matrix.}
}
\description{
This function computes the maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) of
the mean vector \eqn{\mu} and covariance matrix \eqn{\Sigma} for a
multivariate normal distribution, based on a data matrix \eqn{Y}.
}
\details{
The mean is estimated as the sample mean of the data, and the covariance
is computed as the average of the outer products of the centered data.
}
\examples{
set.seed(123)
y <- MASS::mvrnorm(50, mu = c(1,2), Sigma = matrix(c(1,0.3,0.3,1),2,2))
result <- emNMV(y)
result$mu_est
result$sigma_est
