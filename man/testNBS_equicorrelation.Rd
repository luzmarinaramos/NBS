\title{Equicorrelation Test for the Normal-Birnbaum-Saunders Distribution}
\usage{
testNBS_equicorrelation(y, nivel_significancia = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{A numeric matrix of dimension n x p containing the sample.}

\item{nivel_significancia}{Significance level (default is 0.05).}
}
\value{
A list with the following elements:
\item{order}{A character vector with the names of the tests.}
\item{statistics}{A numeric vector with the test statistics.}
\item{p_value}{A numeric vector with the corresponding p-values.}
}
\description{
Performs four classical asymptotic hypothesis tests (Likelihood Ratio, Wald, Score, and Gradient)
to test whether the covariance matrix of a multivariate Normal-Birnbaum-Saunders distribution is equicorrelated.
}
\details{
The function assumes that \code{emNBS} and \code{emNBS_equicorrelation} return objects
that include a logical element \code{converged}. The tests are performed only if both models converge
and the corresponding Fisher information matrices are positive definite. Symmetrization is applied
to the Fisher matrix if necessary. The inverse is computed via Cholesky decomposition for numerical stability.

\examples{
\dontrun{
set.seed(1)
y <- matrix(rnorm(300), ncol = 3)
result <- testNBS_equicorrelation(y)
print(result)
